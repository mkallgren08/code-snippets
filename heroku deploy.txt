The code of this assignment looks solid, but the highest grade I can give you is a D- because the app has to be deployed. Try deploying it to Heroku rather than to Github Pages. To do so, run the following commands in order: 

`heroku create`
	* makes a new heroku app

`git remote -v`
	* Shows the remotes for the git repo. Make sure that you have a fetch and a pull (or push) remote for Heroku

`yarn build`
	* Builds your React app for deployment

`git add .`

`git commit -m "Put your message here"`

`git push heroku master`

If, after running these commands, your app is still not deployed to Heroku properly, go back to the terminal that your app is open in and type:

`heroku logs`

Scroll up through the resulting logs and find the first error that's thrown. Usually it's a missing dependency (solved by running `yarn add [dependency]` ) or a mistyped relative filepath. Good luck!
